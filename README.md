SMALL DISCRIPTION OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TOOL :

It implements a simple Streamlit web application that performs both speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions using the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries. When the user clicks the “Start Listening” button, the application accesses the system microphone to capture audio input. It uses Google's speech recognition service to convert the spoken input into text, which is then displayed on the web interface. After recognizing the speech, the app uses pyttsx3 to convert the recognized text back into audio, saving it temporarily as an MP3 file. This audio is then played back in the browser, and the file is deleted afterward to manage storage. Overall, the app provides an interactive way for users to talk to their computer and hear their own speech echoed back in real-time.
